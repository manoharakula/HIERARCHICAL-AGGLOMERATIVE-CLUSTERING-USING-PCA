# HIERARCHICAL-AGGLOMERATIVE-CLUSTERING-USING-PCA
Engineering, Biology, Psychology, Economics, and  Recommendation systems all use clustering. Because the number of  clusters or model parameters is seldom known and must be decided  before clustering, the number of clusters or model parameters is rarely  known and must be calculated before clustering. A method for  clustering with multiple clusters has been provided. Hierarchical  clustering is a type of cluster analysis used in data mining that aims to  create a hierarchy of clusters. There are two sorts of strategies for  hierarchical clustering: Agglomerative: This is a "bottom-up" strategy  in which each observation is placed in its own cluster, with pairs of  clusters merging as one progresses up the hierarchy. Divisive: This is  a "top down" technique in which all observations begin in one cluster  and are divided iteratively as one progresses down the hierarchy
